## Motivation
This study sheds light on the complexities of Beta herding, and by understanding these dynamics, investors can optimize their portfolios, navigate market fluctuations more effectively, and ultimately achieve better long-term financial outcomes.
The unique combination of quantitative analysis, advanced modelling techniques, and illustrative visualizations provides a comprehensive understanding of Beta herding and its impact on investment strategies.

This analysis helps in understanding how market conditions affect the risk profiles (beta) of different stocks and how unique performance (alpha) remains stable across market cycles. By recognizing these patterns, investors can better manage portfolio risk and identify opportunities for diversification and stability in varying market environments.

## Findings & Insights
- Investors tend to move towards low-beta stocks (less volatile) during both market up and down periods.
- This indicates a preference for stability and lower risk.
- The herding behavior is more pronounced in market down periods.
- In market down periods, the increase in beta for low-beta deciles is significantly higher.
